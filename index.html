            <p>
              I am currently a junior at Harvard College studying <a href="https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/">Social Studies</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science">Computer Science</a>. I've been lucky enough to spend time with the wonderful teams at <a href="https://nea.com">New Enterprise Associates</a>, <a href="https://www.breather.com">Breather</a>, <a href="https://stem.is">Stem</a>, and <a href="https://www.tallwave.com">Tallwave</a>. I often write my opinions on the Internet and private technology markets through <a href="https://medium.com/breakdowns">Breakdowns</a>, a publication I created. <br> From an academic perspective, I enjoy learning about the history of capitalism in America, behavioral economics, and human-computer interaction.
            </p>
            <h2 class="content-subhead">What can I do for you?</h2>
            <p>
              I manage an email list of early-stage investors (both professionals and angels) who I send active seed stage invesmtent opportunities to every few weeks. If you're an investor who's interested in seeing opportunities, contact me <a href="mailto:aashaysanghvi@gmail.com?subject=An%20Interested%20Investor">here</a>. Or, if you're a founder, and you want your company to be featured, get in touch <a href="mailto:aashaysanghvi@gmail.com?subject=An%20Interested%20Founder">here</a>. <br> I'm particularly interested in companies working on real estate asset management, manufacturing, credit financing, the satellite economy, construction, patient-centric digital health, consumer goods for the home, AI and personal productivity, blockchain infrastructure, institutional real asset investment, recruiting tools for banks and buy-side firms, data marketplaces, and tools for private equity.
