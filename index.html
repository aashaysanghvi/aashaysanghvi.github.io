      <p>I'm a senior at Harvard College. I've been on the founding team of <a href="http://www.bureauwork.com">Bureau</a> and worked at <a href="http://notation.vc">Notation</a>. I'm always kicking around ideas and looking for interesting people to work with. Here are a few of the things I've been thinking about recently.</p>

      <h2>Ideas</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">Better Commercial Banking.</span> The jury is still out on whether everyday consumers will switch from legacy brands to challenger or neobanks for checking and savings accounts. On the B2B side, I think startups can bundle additional vertical-specific services around basic treasury management to create an enticing offering. Frank Rotman has some great thoughts on the future of this.<label for="sn-copernican" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-copernican" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/qed-uploads/The+Copernican+Revolution+in+Banking+-+Publication+Version.pdf">The Copernican Revolution in Banking</a></span></p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Distribution-as-a-Service.</span> Customer acquisition is one of the hardest nuts to crack for fintech companies, especially in insurance<label for="sn-insurance" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-insurance" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Insurance is the most expensive keyword on Google.</span> and lending. I would love to see services that enable fintech intermediaries or large players like insurers and banks to reach their customers more effectively.</p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Employee Management 2.0.</span> The nature of organizations is continuing to change, and I'm interested in experiments<label for="sn-byot" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-byot" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Stripe used to have a program called <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/bring-your-own-team">Bring Your Own Team.</a> Sam Gerstenzang also wrote a really interesting piece on the <a href="https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/the-conscious-decoupling-of-the-corporation-f8ab26119943">potential future of organizations.</a></span> and products that encourage fluid behavior. For example, companies actively prepare to "onramping" new hires, but I think they do a bd job of "offramping" them.</p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Restructured Restructuring.</span> Restructuring advisory is a growing field within investment banking and finance. Activities include recapitalizations, debt restructuring, creditor advising, and asset sales. Cost of revenue in this sector is almost entirely compensation based<label for="sn-pjt" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pjt" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See pg. 48 in the <a href="http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001626115/cedce783-d07c-40d2-962b-6aaeeda8f11d.pdf">PJT Partners 2017 10-K.</a></span>, and I wonder if there are ways to productize facets of this business.</p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Home Furnishings and Lighting.</span> Economies of scale for manufacturing and logistics on both ends of the market has squeezed furniture players in the middle. Are there creative ways for furniture brands to tap into local delivery and logistics networks at scale? </p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Enterprise Service Marketplaces.</span> I continue to be interested in this because it touches so many aspects of the enterprise.<label for="sn-mckinsey" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-mckinsey" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://medium.com/breakdowns/the-unbundling-of-mckinsey-and-management-consulting-at-large-9693a8b3532b">The Unbundling of McKinsey</a></span> Supply chain consultants and real estate underwriters are two areas that particularly intrigue me.</p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Tech-Driven Buyouts.</span> Software, or even "software"<label for="sn-wework" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-wework" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See WeWork</span>, tends to drive higher multiples on the market. There's a huge opportunity in private equity to buy independent service businesses in fragmented industries, roll them up into one entity, and supercharge their workflows with internal tools (or even the basics like Slack, Intercom, etc). The aggregate is greater than the sum.</p>
      <p><span class="newthought">Dynamic Yield.</span> Real estate owners and landlords lock in tenants for long durations because it gives them a sense of comfort around their business and long-term yield from assets. But what if new sources of data allowed landlords to better predict revenue with dynamic usage, so maybe they have a co-working space one day and a popup shop the next?</p>
