            <h2 class="content-subhead">About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am currently a rising senior at Harvard College studying <a href="https://socialstudies.fas.harvard.edu/">Social Studies</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science">Computer Science</a>. I work at <a href="https://notation.vc">Notation Capital</a> in Brooklyn, NY. Previously, I've been lucky enough to spend time with the wonderful teams at <a href="https://nea.com">New Enterprise Associates</a>, <a href="https://www.breather.com">Breather</a>, <a href="https://stem.is">Stem</a>, and <a href="https://www.tallwave.com">Tallwave</a>. I often write my opinions on the Internet and private technology markets through <a href="https://medium.com/breakdowns">Breakdowns</a>, a publication I created. From an academic perspective, I enjoy learning about the history of capitalism in America, cultural theory, behavioral economics, and human-computer interaction.

            <h2 class="content-subhead">What am I interested in?</h2>
            <p>
             Right now, I'm particularly interested in software and Internet companies working on:
             <ul>
               <li>Office Furniture: The industry is incredibly opaque and unnecessarily marked up</li>
               <li>Cloud Clinics: Direct-to-consumer health companies that make medication easier to access and understandable</li>
               <li>Modular Hardware: Plug and play solutions that make durable goods, robotics, and pre-fab home development scalable</li>
               <li>Enterprise Labor Marketplaces: Supply chain consultants and investment bankers are among a few areas where this is interesting</li>
               <li>Vertical Banking Platforms: Savings + checking accounts, lending, and vendor management all in one place for medicine, real estate, CPG, etc.</li>
               <li>Passive Income Tools: Make affiliate money by showcasing what's in your apartment or wallet</li>
               <li>Business Insurance: Rethink underwriting practices using APIs and data</li>
               <li>Hyper Targeted FinTech Products: Consumer campaigns, product design, and private-label partnerships under one roof</li>
               <li>Trading Pricing Quotes: Enterprise SaaS deals, pharmaceutical wholesale purchases, etc. Bring transparency to the supply chain</li>
             </ul>
            </p>
